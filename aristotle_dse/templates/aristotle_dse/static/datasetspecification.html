{% block description %}

<P>A data set specification (DSS) is characterised by a selection of data elements which address the requirements within 
the scope statement. The selected data elements must be collected according to the specified guidelines, and may require the user to comply with constraints such as sequencing, conditionality, multiple occurences of the same data element, and multiple responses allowed within a code set.</P> 

<P>Data set specifications may also be associated with other item types such as glossary items or indicators.</P>
